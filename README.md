In this project we have implemented a telephone directory where you can perform different functions on the directory such as add a contact, delete a contact, update info or view your contact list.
We have the source code in the file with name project and there is one more file named abc where we are storing all the data of the telephone direcory.
We have used our knowledge of Binary search tree to implement and create this project and also concepts of file handling are also used.
